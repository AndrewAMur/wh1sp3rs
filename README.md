**Description:**  
You wake in a sprawling, endless maze. The only way forward is to explore, gather the pieces of something dark, and find the key. But the maze is filled with whispers, things that shouldnâ€™t be there, and a door you cannot open without what you need.

**Notes:**  
- Move carefully.  
- Keep an eye out for the key and parts.  
- The door remains locked until you find them.  
- Once inside, everything ends.
